/**
 * Three-Tier Module Architecture Setup
 * 
 * This functionality has been moved to a proper SQL migration for better reliability.
 * 
 * To set up the three-tier module architecture:
 * 1. Navigate to the Supabase SQL editor
 * 2. Run the migration: supabase/migrations/20250712000000-add-module-types.sql
 * 
 * This will:
 * - Add the 'type' column to system_modules table
 * - Classify modules into: super_admin, foundation, business
 * - Create necessary indexes and constraints
 * - Show a summary of the classification
 * 
 * The three types are:
 * 🛡️  Super Admin: System administration and platform management
 * 🏗️  Foundation: Core platform modules that others depend on  
 * 💼 Business: Specialized business functionality modules

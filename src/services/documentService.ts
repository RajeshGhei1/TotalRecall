## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- **Browser Caching:** Cache static resources for 1 year
- **API Caching:** Cache responses based on cache headers
- **Database Caching:** Intelligent query result caching
- **CDN Caching:** Global content distribution

### Request Optimization
- **Field Selection:** Use \`fields\` parameter to limit response size
- **Batch Operations:** Process multiple items in single request
- **Compression:** Enable gzip compression for large responses
- **Connection Pooling:** Reuse HTTP connections

### Best Practices
1. **Use appropriate pagination:** Limit large result sets
2. **Implement exponential backoff:** For retry logic
3. **Cache frequently accessed data:** Reduce API calls
4. **Use webhooks:** For real-time updates instead of polling
5. **Monitor usage:** Track performance metrics and quotas

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- **Rotation:** Rotate API keys every 90 days
- **Environment Separation:** Use different keys per environment
- **Least Privilege:** Grant minimum required permissions
- **Monitoring:** Track API key usage and anomalies

### Data Protection
- **Encryption:** All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Logging:** Comprehensive audit trails
- **IP Whitelisting:** Restrict access by IP address
- **Token Expiration:** Implement short-lived access tokens

## Code Standards and Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards
\`\`\`typescript
// File naming conventions
// Components: PascalCase (UserProfile.tsx)
// Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useUserProfile.ts)
// Utils: camelCase (dataTransforms.ts)
// Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (API_ENDPOINTS.ts)
// Types: PascalCase with interface/type prefix (IUser.ts, UserTypes.ts)

// Type definitions example
interface UserProfile {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly email: string;
  readonly fullName: string;
  readonly createdAt: Date;
  readonly updatedAt: Date;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

// Strict typing for API responses
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  meta: {
    total: number;
    page: number;
    limit: number;
  };
  links: {
    self: string;
    next?: string;
    prev?: string;
  };
}

// Error handling types
interface ApplicationError {
  readonly code: string;
  readonly message: string;
  readonly details?: Record<string, unknown>;
  readonly timestamp: Date;
}

// Component prop types with strict validation
interface UserCardProps {
  user: UserProfile;
  onEdit?: (user: UserProfile) => void;
  onDelete?: (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  className?: string;
  'data-testid'?: string;
}

// Custom hook example with proper typing
function useUserProfile(userId: string): {
  user: UserProfile | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: ApplicationError | null;
  refetch: () => Promise<void>;
} {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<UserProfile | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<ApplicationError | null>(null);

  const fetchUser = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const response = await userService.getUser(userId);
      setUser(response.data);
      setError(null);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err as ApplicationError);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, [userId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser();
  }, [fetchUser]);

  return { user, loading, error, refetch: fetchUser };
}
\`\`\`

### React Component Standards
\`\`\`typescript
// Component structure template
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback, memo } from 'react';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

// Import types
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props definition
}

// Component implementation
const ComponentName = memo<ComponentProps>(({
  prop1,
  prop2,
  className,
  ...restProps
}) => {
  // State declarations
  const [state, setState] = useState<StateType>(initialState);
  
  // Custom hooks
  const { data, loading, error } = useCustomHook();
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleClick = useCallback((event: React.MouseEvent) => {
    // Handle click
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects
    return () => {
      // Cleanup
    };
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Early returns for loading/error states
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorDisplay error={error} />;
  
  // Main render
  return (
    <div 
      className={cn("base-classes", className)}
      data-testid="component-name"
      {...restProps}
    >
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
});

ComponentName.displayName = 'ComponentName';

export default ComponentName;
\`\`\`

### API Service Standards
\`\`\`typescript
// API service structure
class UserService {
  private readonly baseUrl = '/api/v2/users';
  
  async getUsers(params: GetUsersParams): Promise<ApiResponse<UserProfile[]>> {
    try {

## Performance Guidelines

### Frontend Performance Optimization
\`\`\`typescript
// Code splitting and lazy loading
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const UserManagement = lazy(() => import('./pages/UserManagement'));
const Analytics = lazy(() => import('./pages/Analytics'));

// Wrap with Suspense
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route 
          path="/users" 
          element={
            <Suspense fallback={<PageLoader />}>
              <UserManagement />
            </Suspense>
          } 
        />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

// Memoization for expensive calculations
import { useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({ data, filters }) {
  const filteredData = useMemo(() => {
    return data.filter(item => 
      filters.every(filter => filter.test(item))
    );
  }, [data, filters]);

  const handleItemClick = useCallback((itemId: string) => {
    // Handle click without recreating function on every render
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {filteredData.map(item => (
        <Item 
          key={item.id} 
          data={item} 
          onClick={() => handleItemClick(item.id)}

### Backend Performance Guidelines
\`\`\`typescript
// Database query optimization
class UserRepository {
  async findUsersWithCompanies(filters: UserFilters): Promise<User[]> {
    // Use proper indexing and joins
    return this.db.query(\`
      SELECT 
        u.id, u.name, u.email,
        c.id as company_id, c.name as company_name
      FROM users u
      LEFT JOIN user_companies uc ON u.id = uc.user_id
      LEFT JOIN companies c ON uc.company_id = c.id
      WHERE u.created_at >= \$1
        AND u.status = \$2
      ORDER BY u.created_at DESC
      LIMIT \$3 OFFSET \$4
    \`, [filters.since, filters.status, filters.limit, filters.offset]);
  }

  // Implement caching for frequently accessed data
  async getUserById(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
    const cacheKey = \`user:\${id}\`;
    
    // Try cache first
    const cached = await this.cache.get(cacheKey);

    if (user) {
      await this.cache.setex(cacheKey, 3600, JSON.stringify(user));
    }

    return user;
  }
}

// API response optimization
class UserController {
  async getUsers(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
    try {
      const { page = 1, limit = 20, fields } = req.query;
      
      // Implement field selection to reduce payload size
      const users = await this.userService.getUsers({
        page: Number(page),
        limit: Math.min(Number(limit), 100), // Cap limit
        fields: fields ? String(fields).split(',') : undefined
      });

        }
      });
    } catch (error) {
      this.handleError(error, res);
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Security Guidelines

### Input Validation and Sanitization
\`\`\`typescript
import Joi from 'joi';
import xss from 'xss';

// Schema validation
const createUserSchema = Joi.object({
  email: Joi.string().email().required().max(255),
  name: Joi.string().min(2).max(100).required(),
  password: Joi.string()
    .min(12)
    .pattern(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*?&]/)
    .required(),
  role: Joi.string().valid('admin', 'user', 'viewer').required()
});

// Input sanitization middleware
function sanitizeInput(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  // Sanitize string fields to prevent XSS
  if (req.body) {
    Object.keys(req.body).forEach(key => {
      if (typeof req.body[key] === 'string') {
        req.body[key] = xss(req.body[key]);
      }
    });
  }
  next();
}

// SQL injection prevention
class DatabaseService {
  async findUsers(filters: UserFilters): Promise<User[]> {
    // Always use parameterized queries
    const query = \`
      SELECT * FROM users 
      WHERE status = \$1 
        AND created_at >= \$2
        AND (\$3::text IS NULL OR email ILIKE \$3)
      ORDER BY created_at DESC
      LIMIT \$4 OFFSET \$5
    \`;
    
    return this.db.query(query, [
      filters.status,
      filters.since,
      filters.email ? \`%\${filters.email}%\` : null,
      filters.limit,
      filters.offset
    ]);
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Authentication and Authorization
\`\`\`typescript
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

// JWT token management
class AuthService {
  generateTokens(user: User): TokenPair {
    const accessToken = jwt.sign(
      { 
        sub: user.id, 
        email: user.email, 
        role: user.role,
        permissions: user.permissions 
      },
      process.env.JWT_SECRET!,
      { expiresIn: '1h', issuer: 'totalrecall', audience: 'api' }
    );

    const refreshToken = jwt.sign(
      { sub: user.id, type: 'refresh' },
      process.env.JWT_REFRESH_SECRET!,
      { expiresIn: '30d', issuer: 'totalrecall', audience: 'api' }
    );

    return { accessToken, refreshToken };
  }

  async verifyToken(token: string): Promise<JWTPayload> {
    try {
      return jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET!) as JWTPayload;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid token');
    }
  }
}

// Authorization middleware
function requirePermission(permission: string) {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    try {
      const token = extractBearerToken(req);
      const payload = await authService.verifyToken(token);
      
      if (!payload.permissions.includes(permission)) {
        return res.status(403).json({
          error: 'Insufficient permissions'
        });
      }

      req.user = payload;
      next();
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });
    }
  };
}

// Password hashing
class PasswordService {
  private readonly SALT_ROUNDS = 12;

  async hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
    return bcrypt.hash(password, this.SALT_ROUNDS);
  }

  async verifyPassword(password: string, hash: string): Promise<boolean> {
    return bcrypt.compare(password, hash);
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Application Monitoring
\`\`\`typescript
// Error tracking and monitoring
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

// Initialize Sentry
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true }),
    new Sentry.Integrations.Express({ app }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
});

// Error handling middleware
function errorHandler(error: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  // Log error
  console.error('Application error:', error);
  
  // Send to Sentry
  Sentry.captureException(error, {
    tags: {
      component: 'api',
      method: req.method,
      url: req.url,
    },
    user: {
      id: req.user?.id,
      email: req.user?.email,
    },
  });

  // Send appropriate response
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  } else if (error instanceof AuthenticationError) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });
  } else {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
}

// Performance monitoring
import { performance } from 'perf_hooks';

function performanceMiddleware(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  const start = performance.now();
  
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    
    // Log slow requests
    if (duration > 1000) {
      console.warn(\`Slow request: \${req.method} \${req.url} took \${duration.toFixed(2)}ms\`);
    }
    
    // Send metrics to monitoring service
    metrics.timing('request.duration', duration, {
      method: req.method,
      route: req.route?.path,
      status_code: res.statusCode,
    });
  });
  
  next();
}
\`\`\`

### Development Debugging
\`\`\`typescript
// Debug configuration
const debug = {
  enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  
  log(...args: any[]) {
    if (this.enabled) {
      console.log('[DEBUG]', new Date().toISOString(), ...args);
    }
  },
  
  error(...args: any[]) {
    if (this.enabled) {
      console.error('[ERROR]', new Date().toISOString(), ...args);
    }
  },
  
  time(label: string) {
    if (this.enabled) {
      console.time(\`[TIME] \${label}\`);
    }
  },
  
  timeEnd(label: string) {
    if (this.enabled) {
      console.timeEnd(\`[TIME] \${label}\`);
    }
  }
};

// Usage in components
function UserService() {
  async getUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
    debug.time('getUsers');
    debug.log('Fetching users from database');
    
    try {
      const users = await this.db.findUsers();
      debug.log(\`Found \${users.length} users\`);
      return users;
    } catch (error) {
      debug.error('Failed to fetch users:', error);
      throw error;
    } finally {
      debug.timeEnd('getUsers');

    3. DNS update to point to new primary
    4. Application connection pool refresh
    5. Monitoring alert generation
    6. Verification of successful failover
  
  Rollback Procedure:
    1. Assess data consistency between old and new primary
    2. Stop application traffic to new primary
    3. Synchronize data if necessary
    4. Failback to original primary
    5. Update DNS and application configuration
    6. Resume normal operations

Application Failover:
  Load Balancer Configuration:
    - Health checks every 10 seconds
    - Remove unhealthy instances after 3 failed checks
    - Route traffic to healthy instances only
    - Automatic scaling based on load
  
  Container Orchestration:
    - Kubernetes automatic pod restart on failure

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Create Custom Field**
```
Settings → Custom Fields → "Partnership Level" (Dropdown: Bronze/Silver/Gold)
```

### **Step 2: Dashboard Builder Integration**
```
Dashboard Builder → Data Source Config → Select "Companies with Custom Fields"
↓
Columns → See "Partnership Level (Custom)" with purple icon
↓
Filters → Add custom field filter: Partnership Level = "Gold"
↓
Widget Config → Enable "Include Custom Fields Data"
```

### **Step 3: Automatic Widget Rendering**
```
Widget displays:
- Standard company data (name, industry, etc.)
- Custom field values (Partnership Level: Gold, Silver, Bronze)
- Filtered results based on custom field criteria
- Charts/graphs with custom field data points
```

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Data Flow:**
```
Custom Fields Creation
↓
Database Storage (custom_fields + custom_field_values tables)
↓
Dashboard Data Source Selection
↓
Automatic JOIN queries with custom field data
↓
Widget rendering with combined standard + custom data
```

### **Query Example:**
```sql
SELECT 
  companies.*,
  custom_field_values.field_key,
  custom_field_values.value,
  custom_fields.name as field_name
FROM companies
LEFT JOIN custom_field_values 
  ON companies.id = custom_field_values.entity_id 
  AND custom_field_values.entity_type = 'company'
LEFT JOIN custom_fields 
  ON custom_field_values.custom_field_id = custom_fields.id
WHERE custom_field_values.field_key = 'partnership_level'
  AND custom_field_values.value = 'Gold'
```
